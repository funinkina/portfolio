# Hey there, I'm Aryan Kushwaha üëã
### aka *funinkina*

I'm a final-year **Computer Science** undergrad based in **Delhi NCR, India**.  
I spend my time wrangling code, debugging life, and occasionally teaching computers to think.

My comfort zone includes:
  - Machine Learning  
  - Linux  
  - Backend Development  
  - DevOps

## What I'm Up To

- **AI Intern** at [SuperDash](https://superdash.ai/)  
  *Bangalore, Karnataka ¬∑ July 2025 ‚Äì Present*  
  Helping build AI features, probably feeding more data to the machines than I do to myself.

- **Blogger & Backend Developer** at [Let's Code](https://www.lets-code.co.in)  
  *Remote, Part Time ¬∑ April 2025 ‚Äì Present*  
  Writing backend logic and blogs when I'm not busy breaking my Arch install.
