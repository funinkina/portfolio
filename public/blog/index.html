        "content": "What are Inodes? If you are a linux user, you must have encountered some kind Insufficient Permission or File not found errors. These errors are usually caused by the filesystem structure of linux. Ever wondered from where Linux reads these properties of a file? Also if you use symlinks (shortcuts if you are coming from windows) to a file, how is it resolved internally? When I was a beginner, I used to think that Linux reads these properties from the file itself. But then where are these properties stored in the file? It turns out, that\u0026rsquo;s not the case. Linux reads these properties from a data structure called Inode.\nYou can see the files and their permissions using the ls -l command. The output of the ls -l command is shown below:\n~/dotfiles $ ls -l total 1380 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 2107 Dec 19 16:23 config.jsonc -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 1397572 Jan 3 00:40 default.sd.tar.gz -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 3101 Aug 15 20:19 pacman.conf -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 2024 Aug 18 19:22 starship.toml The ls commmand is used to see the files and directories in the current directory. The -l flag is used to see the long listing of the files and directories.\nThis output gives the information about the file permissions, owner, group, size, last modified date, and the name of the file. These permissions are stored as a key-value pair in the Inode data structure.\nNow to see the inode number of the files, we can use ls -ia command. The output of the ls -ia command is shown below:\n~/dotfiles $ ls -li total 1380 24782638 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 2107 Dec 19 16:23 config.jsonc 23986866 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 1397572 Jan 3 00:40 default.sd.tar.gz 24782642 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 3101 Aug 15 20:19 pacman.conf 24782644 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 2024 Aug 18 19:22 starship.toml Let\u0026rsquo;s take the file starship.toml as an example. Here we see 24782644, this is the inode number of the file config.jsonc. You can think of this inode number as a primary key to the Inode data structure of this file. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper into the Inode data structure. We can further see the properties of the file using the stat command. The output of the stat command is shown below:\n~/dotfiles $ stat starship.toml File: starship.toml Size: 2024 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 regular file Device: 254,3\tInode: 24782644 Links: 1 Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 1000/funinkina) Gid: ( 1000/funinkina) Access: 2025-01-28 00:35:58.670392334 +0530 Modify: 2024-08-18 19:22:06.000000000 +0530 Change: 2024-12-27 13:46:50.435495946 +0530 Birth: 2024-12-27 13:43:10.180129427 +0530 Here we can see its size, inode number, how many files links to this file which is 1 in this case, access, modify, change, and birth time of the file. These properties are stored in the Inode data structure of the file.\nInode in Disks Inode is a special kind of data structure that stores metadata about a file. Metadata includes information like file type, file size, file owner, file permissions, file access time, file modification time, file deletion time, etc. Inodes are used to represent files and directories in the filesystem. Each inode is identified by a unique number called inode number.\nThe most popular file system partition in Linux is the ext4 file system. In the ext/2/3/4 or even in UFS file systems, the inode data structure is allocated a certain amount of space (Usually around 1% of the total disk space). This space is used to store the metadata of the file. I will discuss some issues that may arise due to the limited space allocated to the inode data structure later in this article.\nYou can check how much space is taken by the inode data structure using the df -i command. The output of the df -i command is shown below:\n~ $ df -i Filesystem Inodes IUsed IFree IUse% Mounted on /dev/mapper/vol-root 3276800 230296 3046504 8% / /dev/mapper/vol-home 27639808 762127 26877681 3% /home Here we can see that the root partition has 3276800 inodes and 230296 inodes are used. This means that 3046504 inodes are free. The percentage of inodes used is 8%. If you have a linux server with thousands of files, you may run out of inodes. This can give low disk space errors even though you have plenty of space left on the disk. This is a common issue in shared hosting servers. So yes, you can run out of space and not have the ability to create new files despite having plenty of space left on the disk.\nInode Structure An Inode is of 256 bytes in size. Containing the following fields:\nField Mode Link count Owner\u0026rsquo;s UID number Owner\u0026rsquo;s GID number File Size in bytes Time file was last accessed Time file was last modified Time file was last changed 12 Direct block pointers (32/64 bits) to reference upto 16 MB 1 Single Indirect block pointer (32/64 bits) to reference upto 16 MB 1 Double Indirect block pointer (32/64 bits) to reference upto 32 GB 1 Triple Indirect block pointer (32/64 bits) to reference upto 64 TB Inode status (flags) Count of data blocks actually held (Optional) extra reserved fields The Inodes not only store metadata for the file but also store pointers to the disk blocks that store the file data. The disk blocks are used to store the file data. The size of the disk blocks is usually 4 KB. The Inodes store pointers to the disk blocks that store the file data. The Inodes store 15 pointers to the disk blocks that store the file data. They point from the beginning of the file upto 96 KB. If thats not enough, the Inodes store 3 types of indirect pointers to point to the disk blocks that store the file data. These indirect pointers are used to point to the blocks that store the addresses of the disk blocks that store the file data.\nInode Pointers The Inodes store 15 pointers to the disk blocks that store the file data. They point from the beginning of the file upto 16 MB. If thats not enough, the Inodes store 3 types of indirect pointers to point to the disk blocks that store the file data. These indirect pointers are used to point to the blocks that store the addresses of the disk blocks that store the file data.\nThe pointers referred to are disk block addresses - each pointer contains the information necessary to identify a block on disk. Since each disk block is at least 512 bytes (sometimes 4096 or 8192 bytes), using 32-bit addresses the disk can address up to 512 * 4 * 10243 = 2 TiB (Tebibytes - more commonly called Terabytes) assuming 1/2 KiB blocks; correspondingly larger sizes as the block size grows (so 32 TiB at 8 KiB block size). For an addressing scheme for larger disks, you would have to move to larger block sizes or larger disk addresses - hence 48-bit or 64-bit addresses might be plausible.\nDirect Pointers The first 12 pointers are called direct pointers. These direct pointers point to the disk blocks that store the file data. Each direct pointer is points to 8KB chunks. Therefore the maximum file size these direct pointers can represent is 12 pointers X 8 KB = 96KB of data. When the file grows bigger, the disk driver allocates a single indirect block, and records that in the inode. When the driver needs to get a block, it reads the indirect block into memory, and then finds the address for the block it needs from the indirect block. Thus, it requires (nominally) two reads to get to the data, though of course the indirect tends to be cached in memory. There are three types of indirect pointers: The indirect pointers are:\nSingle Indirect Pointer Double Indirect Pointer Triple Indirect Pointer Single Indirect Pointer With an 8 KiB block size and 4-byte disk addresses, you can fit 2048 disk addresses in the single indirect block. So, for files from 96 KiB + 1 byte to 16 MiB or so, there is only a single indirect block.\nDouble Indirect Pointer If a file grows still bigger, then the driver allocates a double indirect block. Each pointer in the double indirect block points to a single indirect block. So, you can have 2048 more indirect blocks, each of which can effectively point at 16 MiB, leading to files of up to 32 GiB (approx) being storable.\nTriple Indirect Pointer If a file grows still larger, then the driver allocates a triple indirect block. Each of the 2048 pointers in a triple indirect block points to a double block. So, under the 32-bit addressing scheme with 32-bit addresses, files up to about 64 TiB could be addressed. Except that you\u0026rsquo;ve run out of disk addresses before that (32 TiB maximum because of the 32-bit addresses to 8 KiB blocks).\nSo to conclude, Indirect pointers in inodes allow modern file systems to handle large files efficiently while keeping inode structures compact. The combination of direct, single, double, and triple indirect pointers ensures scalability without introducing unnecessary overhead for smaller files.\nLinks You must have noticed that the Inode structure also stored something called a link. A link is a pointer to the file. When you create a file, a link is created in the Inode structure. When you create a hard link to a file, a new link is created in the Inode structure. When you create a symbolic link to a file, a new link is created in the Inode structure. When you delete a file, the link is removed from the Inode structure. When you delete a hard link to a file, the link is removed from the Inode structure. When you delete a symbolic link to a file, the link is removed from the Inode structure.\nA link can help you to create multiple references to a file. This can be useful when you want to create a backup of a file. You can create a hard link to the file and then modify the file. The hard link will still point to the original file. This can be useful when you want to create a backup of a file. You can create a symbolic link to the file and then modify the file. The symbolic link will still point to the original file. A soft like can be useful when you want to create a shortcut to a file. You can create a symbolic link to the file and then modify the file. The symbolic link will still point to the original file. A soft link doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be in the same filesystem as the original file while a hard link has to be in the same filesystem as the original file. And a soft link can point to a directory while a hard link can\u0026rsquo;t point to a directory. Soft link doesn\u0026rsquo;t use any extra Inode space while a hard link uses extra Inode space.\nFor example for my dotfiles, I have created a symbolic link of the .zshrc file to the home directory. This way I can keep my dotfiles in a separate directory and still use them in the home directory.\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 funinkina funinkina 31 Dec 23 22:34 .zshrc -\u0026gt; /home/funinkina/dotfiles/.zshrc This way I can keep my dotfiles in a separate directory which has git repository and still use them in the home directory without having to copy them to the home directory.\nConclusion In this article, we discussed what Inodes are and how they are used in Linux.

The Arch User Repository (AUR) is just a cherry on top. Including packages submitted by users makes it even more complete, removing the need for flatpaks or snaps. (Might cause dependency issues, we will discuss this later).\n100% Human written btw\nStill using Pacman and Yay? If you read any basics about Arch, you know that the default way to install packages is pacman, which is great if you only install from the official repositories where pacman beautifully takes care of the dependency issues, but the real culprit to Arch instability issues is caused by packages installed from the AUR, as they might include outdated packages that can potentially break your system. Most probably, you might be using Yay or Paru, as your AUR helpers to get packages from AUR, while they work pretty flawlessly and fast, they also introduce system dependency issues and not work really well with pacman. The solution? Aura\nIntroducing Aura Aura is a fully fledged replacement for pacman with enhancements as well as an AUR helper built-in. Aura provides all the same features as pacman with all the same commands and flags.\nTaken from the Aura\u0026rsquo;s own guide : Aura doesn\u0026rsquo;t just mimic pacman; it is pacman. All pacman operations and their sub-options are accepted, as-is.\nAura also provides a dead simple way to install AUR packages from\naura -As google-chrome Using Aura as pacman also provides multiple extra features such as:\nDowngrading a package\naura -C firefox Discovering what package owns a certain file\naura -Qo firefox /usr/bin/firefox is owned by firefox 127.0.2-1 Using Aura as AUR helper:\nInstalling a package from AUR\naura -As google-chrome Scrutinizing a package\naura -Ai google-chrome Now let\u0026rsquo;s see how do we get started with Aura\nGetting started with Aura To install Aura, we have to compile it from source first.\nStep 1: Grab the code from code and cd into it\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aura.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd aura Step 2: Compile it\nmakepkg -si Then run aura check to see the status.\nSome recommended configurations: First generate the config file by running\naura conf --gen \u0026gt; ~/.config/aura/config.toml If you are not comfortable with vim as editor, change editor=\u0026quot;nano\u0026quot; in [general] of the config file\nPut delmakedeps = true if you want to remove the build dependencies after every install automatically to save space.\nNow you can use\naura -As google-chrome to get started with installing packages.\nSome bonus life hacks A few tricks I use to make installing and removing packages faster and easier is to create aliases in my .zshrc (.bashrc) file, such as\nalias yeet=\u0026#34;aura -Rns\u0026#34; alias update=\u0026#34;aura -Syu\u0026#34; alias install=\u0026#34;install_package\u0026#34; alias search=\u0026#34;search_package\u0026#34; alias list=\u0026#34;aura -Q | grep\u0026#34; install_package() { if ! aura -S \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34;; then echo \u0026#34;\\e[38;2;94;255;190m\\e[1mPackage not found in official repositories. Trying to install from AUR...\\e[m\\n\u0026#34; aura -A \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; fi } search_package() { echo \u0026#34;\\e[38;2;94;255;190m\\e[1m$1 in official repositories:\\e[m\u0026#34; aura -Ss \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;\\n\\e[38;2;94;255;190m\\e[1m$1 in AUR:\\e[m\u0026#34; aura -As \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; } Here, I have simply created aliases to uninstall and install a package using yeet and install. For searching and installing packages, there\u0026rsquo;s a simple script that checks both official and AUR while installing a package. (This is not perfect, I am aware).\nCheck out rest of my configuration in my Dotfiles GitHub repository .\nA word on stability Most people use Arch for its rolling release cycle and being on the bleeding edge, but most of the time, this is the main reason for your system instability, therefore in my opinion, it is best to update your packages weekly. This increases the chance that if a certain bug or dependency was present in an update, it would have been fixed after a few days. Also if you aren\u0026rsquo;t using Nvidia GPU, and your hardware is well-supported by the latest kernel, chances are, it is also supported by the LTS kernel as well. So I would recommend you to switch to LTS kernel for maximum stability.\n",
