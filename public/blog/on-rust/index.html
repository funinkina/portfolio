<main><p>All of us in the &ldquo;Arch Btw&rdquo; cult use it for one of its main selling points, the repositories. Arch Linux&rsquo;s pragmatic approach to its packages makes it so much easier for users to sync packages without fiddling with multiple repositories and dependency hell, making it a one-stop solution. The Arch User Repository (AUR) is just a cherry on top. Including packages submitted by users makes it even more complete, removing the need for flatpaks or snaps.

<p>Most people use Arch for its rolling release cycle and being on the bleeding edge, but most of the time, this is the main reason for your system instability, therefore in my opinion, it is best to update your packages weekly. This increases the chance that if a certain bug or dependency was present in an update, it would have been fixed after a few days.
Also if you aren&rsquo;t using Nvidia GPU, and your hardware is well-supported by the latest kernel, chances are, it is also supported by the LTS kernel as well. So I would recommend you to switch to LTS kernel for maximum stability.</p>

This increases the chance that if a certain bug or dependency was present in an update, it would have been fixed after a few days. Also if you aren\u0026rsquo;t using Nvidia GPU, and your hardware is well-supported by the latest kernel, chances are, it is also supported by the LTS kernel as well. So I would recommend you to switch to LTS kernel for maximum stability.\n",

        "content": "This is a shortened merge of Google\u0026rsquo;s API design guide and Microsoft REST API Guidelines .\nTo write OpenAPI schema swagger documentation is useful. To quickly iterate on a design, semantic versioning should be used. To generate human-readable diff of different versions openapi-diff can be useful.\n1. Resource-oriented design In general URL paths should follow this scheme:\nAPI Service Name Collection ID Resource ID Collection ID Resource ID //storage.googleapis.com /buckets /bucket-id /objects /object-id A storage service has a collection of buckets, where each bucket has a collection of objects.\nAnother example:\nhttps://api.contoso.com/v1.0/people/7011042402/inbox Resource names should be noun and not verb. Resource names should be plural.\n2. Naming and standards Microsoft mostly uses camelCase, Google mostly uses snake_case - this guide will be using camelCase.\nAcronyms should follow the casing conventions as though they were regular words (e.g. Url). All identifiers including namespaces, entityTypes, entitySets, properties, actions, functions and enumeration values should use lowerCamelCase. HTTP headers are the exception and should use standard HTTP convention of Capitalized-Hyphenated-Terms. Full words should be preferred (e.g. message instead of msg). Common property names should be used where applicable:\nName Type Description name string The name field should contain the relative resource name. parent string For resource definitions and List/Create requests, the parent field should contain the parent relative resource name. createTime Timestamp The creation timestamp of an entity. updateTime Timestamp The last update timestamp of an entity. Note: update_time is updated when create/patch/delete operation is performed. deleteTime Timestamp The deletion timestamp of an entity, only if it supports retention. expireTime Timestamp The expiration timestamp of an entity if it happens to expire. startTime Timestamp The timestamp marking the beginning of some time period. endTime Timestamp The timestamp marking the end of some time period or operation (regardless of its success). readTime Timestamp The timestamp at which a particular an entity should be read (if used in a request) or was read (if used in a response). timeZone string The time zone name. It should be an IANA TZ name, such as \u0026ldquo;America/Los_Angeles\u0026rdquo;. For more information, see Wikipedia . regionCode string The Unicode country/region code (CLDR) of a location, such as \u0026ldquo;US\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;419\u0026rdquo;. For more information, see unicode.org . languageCode string The BCP-47 language code, such as \u0026ldquo;en-US\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;sr-Latn\u0026rdquo;. For more information, see unicode.org . mimeType string An IANA published MIME type (also referred to as media type). For more information, see iana.org . displayName string The display name of an entity. title string The official name of an entity, such as company name. It should be treated as the formal version of display_name. description string One or more paragraphs of text description of an entity. filter string The standard filter parameter for List methods. See AIP-160. query string The same as filter if being applied to a search method (ie :search) pageToken string The pagination token in the List request. pageSize int32 The pagination size in the List request. totalSize int32 The total count of items in the list irrespective of pagination. nextPageToken string The next pagination token in the List response. It should be used as page_token for the following request. An empty value means no more result. orderBy string Specifies the result ordering for List requests. progressPercent int32 Specifies the progress of an action in percentage (0-100). The value -1 means the progress is unknown. requestId string A unique string id used for detecting duplicated requests. validateOnly bool If true, it indicates that the given request should only be validated, not executed. id string See Canonical identifier section. location string Opaque URL for some resource. message string Arbitrary message. For resource fields that cannot be set by the clients, they must be documented as \u0026ldquo;Output only\u0026rdquo; fields.\nCanonical identifier In addition to friendly URLs, resources that can be moved or be renamed SHOULD expose a URL that contains a unique stable identifier. It MAY be necessary to interact with the service to obtain a stable URL from the friendly name for the resource, as in the case of the /my shortcut used by some services.\nOne option is to use ULID .\nTime All time values are should be represented as RFC 3339 timestamps:\n2019-10-12T07:20:50.52Z (UTC+0) 2019-10-12T07:20:50.52+00:00 (UTC+0) 2019-10-12T14:20:50.52+07:00 (UTC+7) 2019-10-12T03:20:50.52-04:00 (UTC-4) Durations Durations need to be serialized in conformance with ISO 8601 with the following format:\nP[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S Example (3 years, 6 months, 4 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds):\nP3Y6M4DT12H30M5S Intervals Intervals are defined as part of ISO 8601. It seems sufficient to support only the following formats:\nStart and end, such as\n2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z Start and duration, such as\n2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M 3. HTTP Methods Method HTTP Request Body HTTP Response Body Is Idempotent Description GET N/A Resource list True Return the specified resource. GET N/A Resource True Return a list of resources. POST Resource Resource False Create a new object, or submit a command. PUT Resource Resource True Replace an object. PATCH Resource Resource False Apply a partial update to an object. DELETE N/A \u0026hellip; True Delete an object. HEAD N/A \u0026hellip; True Return metadata of an object for a GET response. 4. Headers A good reference for standard headers can be found on MDN . The most common are listed below.\nStandard request headers Header Description Examples Authorization Authorization header for the request. Authorization: Bearer \u0026lt;token\u0026gt; Date Timestamp of the request in client time. Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT[1] Accept The requested content type for the response. Accept: application/json Content-Type Media type of the resource. Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8, Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=something If-None-Match See ETags section If-None-Match: \u0026quot;686897696a7c876b7e\u0026quot; Standard response headers Response Header Description Examples Date Timestamp of the response in server time. Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT Content-Type Media type of the resource. Content-Type: application/json Content-Encoding Lists any encodings that have been applied to the representation, and in what order. Content-Encoding: deflate, gzip ETag See ETags section. ETag: \u0026quot;33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4\u0026quot; 5. Status codes Full list of HTTP status codes can be found on MDN . The most common are listed below.\nCode Description 200 OK The request succeeded. 201 Created The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. 202 Accepted The request was accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. 304 Not Modified Indicates that the resource has not been modified (see Etags section). 400 Bad Request The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error 401 Unauthorized The request requires user authentication. 403 Forbidden The client does not have access rights to the content. 404 Not Found A specified resource is not found. 405 Method Not Allowed The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. 409 Conflict This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server. 429 Too Many Requests The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\u0026ldquo;rate limiting\u0026rdquo;). 500 Internal Server Error The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle. 502 Bad Gateway This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, got an invalid response. 503 Service Unavailable The server is not ready to handle the request. 6. JSON body Success To separate actual data from metadata (lake pagination, etc), the JSON body of response should put data object under value key.\n{ \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;street\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1st Avenue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Seattle\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;street\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;124th Ave NE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Redmond\u0026#34; } ] } Error Error object should be under error key. Response body should use the following structure:\n{ \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;BadArgument\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Multiple errors in ContactInfo data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ContactInfo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;details\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NullValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PhoneNumber\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Phone number must not be null\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NullValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;LastName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Last name must not be null\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MalformedValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Address\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Address is not valid\u0026#34; } ] } } code, message and details (can be empty array) are required fields.\nNote, that message fields are not to be used to display to client. Instead client and server should design a set of error codes specified by code field (that does not nececcerily match HTTP status codes).\n7. Common patterns Pagination All APIs that return lists should support pagination. Client-driven paging seems to be the most popular.\nClients MAY use $top and $skip query parameters to specify a number of results to return and an offset into the collection. When both $top and $skip are given by a client, the server SHOULD first apply $skip and then $top on the collection.\nGET http://api.contoso.com/v1.0/people?$top=5\u0026amp;$skip=2 For server-driven paging, Google\u0026rsquo;s guide is useful.\nSorting Sorting is defined by a query parameter $orderBy.\nThe string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of fields. For example: foo,bar. The default sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix desc should be appended to the field name. For example: foo desc,bar.\nFiltering $filter query parameter is evaluated for each resource in the collection, and only items where the expression evaluates to true are included in the response.\nExample 1: return all Products whose Price is less than $10.00:\nGET https://api.contoso.com/v1.0/products?$filter=price lt 10.00 Example 2: all products with the name \u0026lsquo;Milk\u0026rsquo; that also have a price less than 2.55:\nGET https://api.contoso.com/v1.0/products?$filter=name eq \u0026#39;Milk\u0026#39; and price lt 2.55 The value of the $filter option is a Boolean expression.\nMicrosoft lists the set of operations filter should support:\nOperator Description Example Comparison Operators eq Equal city eq \u0026lsquo;Redmond\u0026rsquo; ne Not equal city ne \u0026lsquo;London\u0026rsquo; gt Greater than price gt 20 ge Greater than or equal price ge 10 lt Less than price lt 20 le Less than or equal price le 100 Logical Operators and Logical and price le 200 and price gt 3.5 or Logical or price le 3.5 or price gt 200 not Logical negation not price le 3.5 Grouping Operators () Precedence grouping (priority eq 1 or city eq \u0026lsquo;Redmond\u0026rsquo;) and price gt 100 For more examples and operator precedence look at Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s guide .\nWhen a filter is performed on a collection and the result set is empty you must respond with a valid response body and a 200 response code.\nLong Running Operations Services should be as responsive as possible, so as not to block callers. As a rule of thumb any API call that is expected to take longer than 0.5 seconds in the 99th percentile, should consider using the following Long-running Operations pattern for those calls.\nThe operation resource must be returned directly as the response message and any immediate consequence of the operation should be reflected in the API. For example, when creating a resource, that resource should appear in GET method though the resource should indicate that it is not ready for use. When the operation is complete, the value field should contain the value that would have been returned directly, if the method was not long running.\nAccess Sub-Collections Sometimes, an API needs to let a client search across sub- collections. For example, the Library API has a collection of shelves, and each shelf has a collection of books, and a client wants to search for a book across all shelves.\nGET https://library.googleapis.com/v1/shelves/-/books?filter=xxx GET https://library.googleapis.com/v1/shelves/-/books/{id} ETags In typical usage, when a URL is retrieved, the Web server will return the resource\u0026rsquo;s current representation along with its corresponding ETag value, which is placed in an HTTP response header \u0026ldquo;ETag\u0026rdquo; field:\nETag: \u0026#34;686897696a7c876b7e\u0026#34; The client may then decide to cache the representation, along with its ETag. Later, if the client wants to retrieve the same URL resource again, it will first determine whether the locally cached version of the URL has expired (through the Cache-Control and the Expire headers). If the URL has not expired, it will retrieve the locally cached resource. If it is determined that the URL has expired (is stale), the client will send a request to the server that includes its previously saved copy of the ETag in the \u0026ldquo;If-None-Match\u0026rdquo; field.\nIf-None-Match: \u0026#34;686897696a7c876b7e\u0026#34; On this subsequent request, the server may now compare the client\u0026rsquo;s ETag with the ETag for the current version of the resource. If the ETag values match, meaning that the resource has not changed, the server may send back a very short response with a HTTP 304 Not Modified status. The 304 status tells the client that its cached version is still good and that it should use that.\nThrottling Services should be as responsive as possible, so as not to block callers. As a rule of thumb any API call that is expected to take longer than 0.5 seconds in the 99th percentile, should consider using the Long-running Operations pattern for those calls.\nHTTP specifies two return codes for these scenarios: \u0026lsquo;429 Too Many Requests\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;503 Service Unavailable\u0026rsquo;. Services should use 429 for cases where clients are making too many calls and can fix the situation by changing their call pattern. Services should respond with 503 in cases where general load or other problems outside the control of the individual callers is responsible for the service becoming slow.\nTo avoid cascading failures, Circuit Breaker pattern can be used (Go implementation ).\nNotes [1] The time format in Date header is important .
