        "tags": ["Linux",],
        "content": "What are Inodes? If you are a linux user, you must have encountered some kind Insufficient Permission or File not found errors. These errors are usually caused by the filesystem structure of linux. Ever wondered from where Linux reads these properties of a file? Also if you use symlinks (shortcuts if you are coming from windows) to a file, how is it resolved internally? When I was a beginner, I used to think that Linux reads these properties from the file itself. But then where are these properties stored in the file? It turns out, that\u0026rsquo;s not the case. Linux reads these properties from a data structure called Inode.\nYou can see the files and their permissions using the ls -l command. The output of the ls -l command is shown below:\n~/dotfiles $ ls -l total 1380 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 2107 Dec 19 16:23 config.jsonc -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 1397572 Jan 3 00:40 default.sd.tar.gz -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 3101 Aug 15 20:19 pacman.conf -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 2024 Aug 18 19:22 starship.toml The ls commmand is used to see the files and directories in the current directory. The -l flag is used to see the long listing of the files and directories.\nThis output gives the information about the file permissions, owner, group, size, last modified date, and the name of the file. These permissions are stored as a key-value pair in the Inode data structure.\nNow to see the inode number of the files, we can use ls -ia command. The output of the ls -ia command is shown below:\n~/dotfiles $ ls -li total 1380 24782638 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 2107 Dec 19 16:23 config.jsonc 23986866 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 1397572 Jan 3 00:40 default.sd.tar.gz 24782642 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 3101 Aug 15 20:19 pacman.conf 24782644 -rw-r--r-- 1 funinkina funinkina 2024 Aug 18 19:22 starship.toml Let\u0026rsquo;s take the file starship.toml as an example. Here we see 24782644, this is the inode number of the file config.jsonc. You can think of this inode number as a primary key to the Inode data structure of this file. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper into the Inode data structure. We can further see the properties of the file using the stat command. The output of the stat command is shown below:\n~/dotfiles $ stat starship.toml File: starship.toml Size: 2024 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 regular file Device: 254,3\tInode: 24782644 Links: 1 Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 1000/funinkina) Gid: ( 1000/funinkina) Access: 2025-01-28 00:35:58.670392334 +0530 Modify: 2024-08-18 19:22:06.000000000 +0530 Change: 2024-12-27 13:46:50.435495946 +0530 Birth: 2024-12-27 13:43:10.180129427 +0530 Here we can see its size, inode number, how many files links to this file, access, modify, change, and birth time of the file. These properties are stored in the Inode data structure of the file.\nInode Data Structure Inode is a special kind of data structure that stores metadata about a file. Metadata includes information like file type, file size, file owner, file permissions, file access time, file modification time, file deletion time, etc. Inodes are used to represent files and directories in the filesystem. Each inode is identified by a unique number called inode number.\nThe most popular file system partition in Linux is the ext4 file system. In the ext/2/3/4 or even in UFS file systems, the inode data structure is allocated a certain amount of space (Usually around 1% of the total disk space). This space is used to store the metadata of the file. I will discuss some issues that may arise due to the limited space allocated to the inode data structure later in this article.\nYou can check how much space is taken by the inode data structure using the df -i command. The output of the df -i command is shown below:\n~ $ df -i Filesystem Inodes IUsed IFree IUse% Mounted on /dev/mapper/vol-root 3276800 230296 3046504 8% / /dev/mapper/vol-home 27639808 762127 26877681 3% /home Here we can see that the root partition has 3276800 inodes and 230296 inodes are used. This means that 3046504 inodes are free. The percentage of inodes used is 8%. The home partition has 27639808 inodes and 762127 inodes are used. This means that 26877681 inodes are free. The percentage of inodes used is 3%.\nInode Structure The Inode data structure is divided into two parts: Inode Table and Inode Table Entry. The Inode Table is an array of Inode Table Entry. Each Inode Table Entry contains the metadata of a file. The Inode Table Entry contains the following fields:\n",

        "content": "All of us in the \u0026ldquo;Arch Btw\u0026rdquo; cult use it for one of its main selling points, the repositories. Arch Linux\u0026rsquo;s pragmatic approach to its packages makes it so much easier for users to sync packages without fiddling with multiple repositories and dependency hell, making it a one-stop solution. The Arch User Repository (AUR) is just a cherry on top. Including packages submitted by users makes it even more complete, removing the need for flatpaks or snaps. (Might cause dependency issues, we will discuss this later).\n100% Human written btw\nStill using Pacman and Yay? If you read any basics about Arch, you know that the default way to install packages is pacman, which is great if you only install from the official repositories where pacman beautifully takes care of the dependency issues, but the real culprit to Arch instability issues is caused by packages installed from the AUR, as they might include outdated packages that can potentially break your system. Most probably, you might be using Yay or Paru, as your AUR helpers to get packages from AUR, while they work pretty flawlessly and fast, they also introduce system dependency issues and not work really well with pacman. The solution? Aura\nIntroducing Aura Aura is a fully fledged replacement for pacman with enhancements as well as an AUR helper built-in. Aura provides all the same features as pacman with all the same commands and flags.\nTaken from the Aura\u0026rsquo;s own guide : Aura doesn\u0026rsquo;t just mimic pacman; it is pacman. All pacman operations and their sub-options are accepted, as-is.\nAura also provides a dead simple way to install AUR packages from\naura -As google-chrome Using Aura as pacman also provides multiple extra features such as:\nDowngrading a package\naura -C firefox Discovering what package owns a certain file\naura -Qo firefox /usr/bin/firefox is owned by firefox 127.0.2-1 Using Aura as AUR helper:\nInstalling a package from AUR\naura -As google-chrome Scrutinizing a package\naura -Ai google-chrome Now let\u0026rsquo;s see how do we get started with Aura\nGetting started with Aura To install Aura, we have to compile it from source first.\nStep 1: Grab the code from code and cd into it\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aura.git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd aura Step 2: Compile it\nmakepkg -si Then run aura check to see the status.\nSome recommended configurations: First generate the config file by running\naura conf --gen \u0026gt; ~/.config/aura/config.toml If you are not comfortable with vim as editor, change editor=\u0026quot;nano\u0026quot; in [general] of the config file\nPut delmakedeps = true if you want to remove the build dependencies after every install automatically to save space.\nNow you can use\naura -As google-chrome to get started with installing packages.\nSome bonus life hacks A few tricks I use to make installing and removing packages faster and easier is to create aliases in my .zshrc (.bashrc) file, such as\nalias yeet=\u0026#34;aura -Rns\u0026#34; alias update=\u0026#34;aura -Syu\u0026#34; alias install=\u0026#34;install_package\u0026#34; alias search=\u0026#34;search_package\u0026#34; alias list=\u0026#34;aura -Q | grep\u0026#34; install_package() { if ! aura -S \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34;; then echo \u0026#34;\\e[38;2;94;255;190m\\e[1mPackage not found in official repositories. Trying to install from AUR...\\e[m\\n\u0026#34; aura -A \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; fi } search_package() { echo \u0026#34;\\e[38;2;94;255;190m\\e[1m$1 in official repositories:\\e[m\u0026#34; aura -Ss \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;\\n\\e[38;2;94;255;190m\\e[1m$1 in AUR:\\e[m\u0026#34; aura -As \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; } Here, I have simply created aliases to uninstall and install a package using yeet and install. For searching and installing packages, there\u0026rsquo;s a simple script that checks both official and AUR while installing a package. (This is not perfect, I am aware).\nCheck out rest of my configuration in my Dotfiles GitHub repository .\nA word on stability Most people use Arch for its rolling release cycle and being on the bleeding edge, but most of the time, this is the main reason for your system instability, therefore in my opinion, it is best to update your packages weekly. This increases the chance that if a certain bug or dependency was present in an update, it would have been fixed after a few days. Also if you aren\u0026rsquo;t using Nvidia GPU, and your hardware is well-supported by the latest kernel, chances are, it is also supported by the LTS kernel as well. So I would recommend you to switch to LTS kernel for maximum stability.\n",
